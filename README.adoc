== Setup

=== Prerequisites

If you're using RVM, make sure you switch away from any gemset:

[source, bash]
----
rvm use default
----

or
[source, bash]
----
rvm use system
----

NOTE: For some reason, when you use the system Ruby on Fedora, you also have to add the json gem to the Gemfile.

=== Install

The following will install the gems into the project.

[source, bash]
----
rm -f Gemfile.lock
bundle config --local github.https true
bundle --path=.bundle/gems --binstubs=.bundle/.bin
----

== Build, with Rake

[source, bash]
----
bundle exec rake
